# Go Snake
Snake written in Go

## Playing
You use the arrow keys to move. If you bump into your body or a wall, press the space key

## Building
You should follow the instructions at the [Ebiten Site](https://ebiten.org/documents/install.html) to install Ebiten.
Once you have that done, you can just do
```
git clone https://github.com/aslikr42069/go-snake.git
cd go-snake
go build
```
and you'll have a binary named `go-snake` (or `go-snake.exe` on Windows)
